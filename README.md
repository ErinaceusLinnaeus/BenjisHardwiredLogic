## Description:
##### Benjis Hardwired Logic…

##### ...is a set of tools to predefine staging actions in your rocket.

##### Launch Clamps can release after a given time (whenever you think the engine is spooled up).
##### Fairings can automatically be jettisoned at a given altitude.
##### RCS and Decoupler can be activated at a set time after launch or prior to reaching Apside.
##### Engines can ignite at a set time after launch or prior to reaching Apside. An engine can also be cut when a set Apside is reached. An Apoogee Kick Motor can either Burn-Out, Circularize or Cut-Off at a set Apside.

##### On-Screen appearing messages for all events can be turned on / off (in VAB and Flight).


##### Check out the awesome flowchart in the pdf provided.
